**Problem Statement :**
Despite significant technological advancements in recent years, the education system lags far behind. To the extent that the industry is producing inefficient students, the student profile is best represented by a normal distribution curve, with more than 60% of the human resource not being used efficiently.
While we have created smart cities, we have not yet been able to create a smart population, and this takes a huge chunk from the potential GDP. India is blessed with a population mostly comprising youth, yet we are still far away from being a superpower.

 Our pitch is to leverage AI to cater to the needs of students at the individual level.
